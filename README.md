# Skyriding Race Addon

Save your best skyriding course's times and compete with your friends !

Type /srr to display the scores window.

Features:

- Save your races
- Save your best time on both normal and advanced courses
- Consult the list of your personal best times
- Consult the list of your guildmates' best times (require said guildmates to also have this addon)
- Check the gold time on every course in both modes

This addon requires the game to be in english, german, french or chinese. If you want to make it work in another language, add a translation file and change the NPC name (and let me know so that I can update the addon for everyone!)
